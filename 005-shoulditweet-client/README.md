Should I Tweet Client
=====================

Server MVC apps have gone out of fashion. Everyone loves their client-side user interfaces because of their responsiveness and slow download times.

Rebuild the application from 004-shoulditweet2 as a client-side javascript application. Choose one of the available client-side application libraries to help give structure to your program.

On the server use asp.net web api to provide the web services required by your client-side application. The required endpoints will be:

* a post endpoint for accepting proto-tweets and returning the results.
* a post endpoint for adding new problematic phrases
* a put (or patch) endpoint for modifying problematic phrases
* a delete endpoint for deleting problematic phrases

Non-functional Requirements
----------------------------

* Attempt to make the application usable on tablet and mobile devices. A CSS framework like bootstrap might help.
* Deploy your application to the Azure free website hosting.
