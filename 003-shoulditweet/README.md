Should I Tweet?
==============

Some people have a hard time knowing what appropriate to share on social media. You will create a web application to help with this problem!

The solution should have a list of verboten phrases ('Trump' or '#selfie' for example). When a user submits a potential tweet (string of characters <= 140 characters) the application will search the tweet and report:
* that the tweet does not contain any problematic phrases
* that the tweet does contain problematic phrases

Therefore the user interface is a single page containing a textarea and a button.

Non-functional Requirements
--------------------

* Construct the application as an asp.net mvc web application. 

Other considerations
-------------------

* What happens when the user submits the form with nothing in the text area, or too much in the text area?
